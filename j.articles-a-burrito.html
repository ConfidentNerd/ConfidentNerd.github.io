    <div class="container-small">
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was 2am, and I was pretty hungry and fairly drunk. Me and my friend were just wrapping around our night out, and getting ready to head back to the hostel, when we luckily stumbled upon an interesting looking burrito stand. Believe it or not, but I had no idea my love for burritos will ever get me to learn anything, especially not to learn a lesson I&#39;ll remember for a while about making the right decisions in life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we came to the stand, we discovered there are 3 different types of burritos they&#39;re selling. The chicken burrito, the classic beef burrito, and a new flavor, the honey chicken burrito.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m usually not very picky with food, but for some reason, this was a complicated choice. I&#39;ve eaten chicken burritos in the past, and they&#39;ve never really scratched the itch I have for Mexican food. Beef burritos however, are a god&#39;s gift from heaven, they&#39;re meaty, full of taste, and definitely one of my favorite foods. The choice should&#39;ve been obvious, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The new neighbor in town got me questioning my answer. Should I go for the classic thing that I know I&#39;ll enjoy, or should I go for the honey filled wild new experience?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went for the honey chicken, and with my first bite I instantly realized. It was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But don&#39;t be sad yet! (I always get sad if someone eats a bad burrito) This story isn&#39;t about me crying about the burrito I ate 2 months ago. This is the part of the night where I started understanding things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as you can Imagine a drunk guy would do when eating an unsatisfying meal at 02:00 am, I started to question the way we make decisions in life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This actually has a lot of importance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We make decisions in life all the time, and many of them is if we should go for something we like, or for something new.</span></p><ul class="c4 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">When you plan your vacations abroad, how do you decide if you should visit the countries you enjoyed, or visiting a brand new place?</span></li><li class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">When you&#39;re going to the supermarket, should you spend your money on buying one of the new soda flavors? and what if they have 20 new flavors, do you taste them all?</span></li><li class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">When you date, how do you know that it&#39;s time to stay with the girl you like? and when is it a good idea to look for someone better?</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While unsatisfyingly gording myself with an abomination of a burrito, I tried to answer all of these questions, and it got me to realize.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2 class="c9"><span class="c12">We should go for what we expect to lead to the best experience</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It all started with understanding the best decision for a good burrito (Of course).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I had a choice between an old classic that I know I would enjoy, it wouldn&#39;t make any sense to gamble that away for something else, unless... </span></p><ul class="c4 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">I got tired from the same old thing (I&#39;m not expecting to enjoy it) </span></li><li class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m expecting the new thing to be even better</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That means, that if I plan my vacations abroad, I should go visit the countries I&#39;m most excited about. If I&#39;ve never been to Europe, but I&#39;m more excited visiting South East Asia again, there&#39;s no point in going against my gut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not saying you should be closed to trying new experiences, you obviously should always stay with an open mind. However, don&#39;t ever say yes to experiences just to say that you&#39;ve tried them out, say yes because you are EXCITED to do them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of my friends got married to the first girl he kissed and dated, and I remember our conversation about this. He&#39;s a smooth good looking dude, and many of his friends constantly ask him how come he never tried to be with a different girl, and isn&#39;t he worried that he is missing out or made the wrong choice?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s answer: &quot;If I&#39;m already having fun now, why would I care about looking for better?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, this is one of the main ideas in our modern consumer society. We feel like we need to get more, enjoy more, get better things, be better people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You should only strive for the things that you&#39;re genuinely excited about, and expect to enjoy. It would make no sense to gamble away good experiences if you don&#39;t think the alternative will be worth it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re time here is limited, and you&#39;ll never be able to eat all the different foods, visit all the different places, date all the different people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t let FOMO determine how you live your life, and eat some god damn beef burritos!</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c5"></span></p>
