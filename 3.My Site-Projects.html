                    <h2>First Aid: Learn How to Save a Life - Udemy</h2>
                    <p>Probably the project I'm currently proud of the most. I made this when I had pain in my feet after the army, which gave me a hard time to work under an employer. <br>
                    This course got a best selling status on the site for some time, and generates a small amount of passive income to me even until this day.</p>

                    <h2>Street Workout For Beginners: Win Over Your Habits</h2>
                    <p>After the big success of the previous course, I decided to create one more. This one focuses on working out rather than first aid. I created this one while being employed in <br>
                    a full time job. Unfortunately this didn't get the same success as the earlier one since apparently the niche was too crowded, but in my eyes it was worth the effort non the less.</p>

                    <h2>Youtube Channel Idea</h2>
                    <p>This was a short attempt. I always liked the direction of helping people out and promoting self growth. To do so I had an idea of creating a following on youtube, starting out with fun informational videos to eventually transition to talk about habits and our psychology. <br>
                        This ended up with one video realising it wasn't for me, but hey! I got a neat brand name and logo out of it!

                    <h2>The Writing Journey</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if it quite fits as a project, but it would be crazy not to include this here. <br>
                        At the end of the day, I realised that all the projects I ever did, they all involved writing. (The courses needed a script, and same for the videos), so why not just
                        write my message? <br> It can be simple and straight forward, a habit focused on the actual things I care about. <br>
                        So far I have written a few English articles you can already check on the site! and I'm working on many others as well.
