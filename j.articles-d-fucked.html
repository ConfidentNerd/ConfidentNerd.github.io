<p class="c3"><span class="c1"><br>It seems these days that the world is going to shit. Obesity is on the rise, more and more people are becoming ill with cancer, global warming is just becoming a bigger issue, the Middle East doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s getting any closer to peace, and the overall suicide rate is on a major increase. So why am I so optimistic?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In this article today, </span><span class="c2">we are going</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to focus on the big picture. I am not going to make the argument that disasters and human deaths are a good thing. (come on, I love you guys :D). Today we&#39;re going to talk about how and why in the long run, we have a bright future ahead of us, and how it is part </span><span class="c2">of human</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;nature to miss that point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"><br></span><span class="c5">Are We That Fucked?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">People always liked to complain, however with the increase in the popularity of the news and social media, it seems that people today are more upset </span><span class="c2">than</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;ever.<br>Some complain about the high cost of living, others about the traffic and the necessity of better public transport, and many about politics and corruption. Some people even make the argument that it is absurd that we&#39;re living like this, if it&#39;s the high price of buying a house, the huge expenses for raising kids, the debt we have to accumulate to go to college, or the increase in rates of deadly diseases, and environmental pollution.<br><br>If that&#39;s not enough, we hear horror stories on the news on a daily basis. We&#39;re often reminded about different disasters like that of WW2, we are exposed to many shocking terror attacks, murders, rape stories, and non-stop predictions about the next big disaster that the future may hold.<br><br>For many, it seems that the world is going to the toilet, and we don&#39;t have enough air freshener to cover up the smell. (eww)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not going to lie, Many of these arguments do raise awareness to some very important issues that we should deal with. However the claim that we are heading in the wrong direction sounds bizarre if you ask me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Before addressing these topics, and discussing what may or may not happen, it&#39;s important in my opinion to take a look at the fucked up shit we had to deal with in the past, and th</span><span class="c2">us</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;widen our perspective </span><span class="c2">about how we got into this situation in the first place</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The Past Was Way More Fucke</span><span class="c14">d</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If we take a look at human history, and compare it to the </span><span class="c2">things </span><span class="c1">we complain about today, </span><span class="c2">we </span><span class="c1">will find out that our situation isn</span><span class="c2">&rsquo;t all that bad, and in fact, it might</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;seem that</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;relatively</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;today we&#39;re living in some kind of heaven.<br><br></span><span class="c2">It depends of course on</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;how far</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;back we go</span><span class="c1">,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;but generally speaking, the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;further we go the more human suffering was present.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"><br>If we go to the long long past, we will find out human beings weren&#39;t always at the top of the food chain, and were actually fighting for scraps.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Before we developed the spoken language, and rose up to the top using the power of many, we use to live in small, not effectively cooperated groups. Historians found, that some of the first man made tools, were created to crack bones of dead animals, to eat the bone marrow inside, thus proving that before humans rose to the top, we were actually approaching animals only after they were already eaten by carnivores and licked clean by scavengers!<br><br>If we advance to the time after the development of language, we will find that humans lived in hunter gatherer tribes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Many consider living in these tribes as the ultimate human experience. It seems that our body and nature was built to be hunter-gatherers, right?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well maybe our posture and fitness would be better. But while living in those tribes, our life expectancy was rarely higher </span><span class="c2">than</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;45.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In fact, researchers have estimated that around 57% of hunter-gatherers reach the age of 15. Of those that reach 15 years of age, 64% continue to live to or past the age of 45. This places the life expectancy between 21 and 37 years. (Today it&#39;s around 80)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They further estimate that 70% of deaths are due to diseases of some kind, 20% of deaths come from violence or accidents and 10% are due to degenerative diseases.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that living in some of those tribes, if you have a sickness or a defect that will slow you down, in most cases your fate would be to stay behind and starve, or be killed for the survival of the greater good.<br><br>Let&#39;s advance one more time, and take a look at human society, from the time we formed villages, all the way up until the end of medieval times.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In most of this period of history, more than 90% of people were poor farmers and peasants, working the land and paying a ridiculous amount of crops to the king for protection from other societies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In these times, people were eating food which was a lot less healthy compared to the hunter-gatherer tribes, they moved their bodies in ways that weren&#39;t ideal for how we evolved, they were very dependent on their surroundings, often times dying from droughts, and working overtime to hopefully gain enough food to survive the next drought that may come. And oh boy, don&#39;t get me started on the amount of disease in the tightly populated areas, and the insane amount of violence and deaths, from other societies of course, but also from within themselves.</span></p><h2 class="c4 c15" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c2">Our Concerns in Modern Times:</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c8">Violence</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is worth to note that researchers found that in the first ancient villages, about 15 percent of deaths were as a result of violence between themselves!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">With time and the rise of empires and countries, this number decreased massively.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"><br>Just to put this </span><span class="c2">into</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;perspective once more, people often complain and are afraid </span><span class="c2">of</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the dreadful terrorist attacks that sometimes happen these days. The media of course makes sure to cover them from every single angle, and many countries throw a ridiculous amount of funds to protect themselves from these attacks and potential wars. So for our example, we will take Israel, a middle eastern country, while the 2006 War of Lebanon was going on.<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In 2006, 116 Israelis died in the war, another 29 in terror attacks, and 148 from crime related violence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So in 2006, a total of 293 Israelis died to violence. this is considered as an appalling number these days (Especially if you live in Israel and see all the sadness around these deaths). However zooming out, that&#39;s only 0.75% out of the 39,000 Israelis who died that year.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you compare that to the 400 deaths by suicide that happened that year, which is 1% of deaths, it basically means that it&#39;s more likely that you will hurt yourself than others will hurt you, while in war time!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some of you might argue that the general death toll of 39,000 is high, or that the suicide number is, but actually that&#39;s not the case. Israel is considered as a relatively advanced &quot;western&quot; country, with relatively good health care and safety precautions. Also Israel is actually considered to be a country with a considerably low number of suicide attempts, lower then Italy, New Zealand, and even Germany!<br><br>Don&#39;t get the wrong idea though, Israel is not an exceptional island of peace.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the whole world that year, about 310,000 people died from war, and another 520,000 from crime. These 830,000, were only 1.5% of the general worldly death toll that year. (while most happened in weaker countries like Somalia or Colombia.) Compare that to the estimated 20% death toll by violence of hunter-gatherers, or 15% death toll of ancient villagers and it becomes hard to imagine how they lived back then.<br><br></span><span class="c8">Disease</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The number of cancer patients in the modern world is rising, especially in advanced western countries, and there is no doubt about that, but have you ever wondered why?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"><br>It seems that people in poorer countries get sick a lot less often compared to the advanced ones, however if we look at known disease risk factors, like diet, exercise and </span><span class="c2">lifestyle</span><span class="c1">, it doesn&#39;t seem that people in these countries live a healthier </span><span class="c2">lifestyle</span><span class="c1">. So how come they&#39;re so much healthier when it comes to cancer? Well, it&#39;s a pretty ugly way to look at this, but it seems that the ability to eventually get sick with cancer, is a luxury compared to poorer countries, where many people starve, die from infections, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases which are not as fatal in advanced countries with good health care.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"><br>I&#39;m not saying that cancer is a good thing (I </span><span class="c2">used</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to work with cancer patients, it&#39;s some fucked up shit), however the increase in this sickness usually means that people generally succeed to live a relatively long time, with an unhealthy lifestyle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">(I won&#39;t lie, I&#39;m generalizing a bit here. Young people, and/or people who keep a healthy lifestyle might get sick with this disease as well, however in general, it seems that the highest number of people who get sick are older people and people who keep unhealthy habits).<br><br></span><span class="c8">Obesity</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Cardiovascular disease is currently considered as the number one cause for deaths in the world.</span></p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s more deadly than cancer though.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Researchers found that In the high-income countries, &quot;death from cancer was twice that from cardiovascular disease,&quot; they wrote in the study. Whereas, in the low-income countries, &quot;death from cardiovascular disease was three times that from cancer&quot;.<br><br>Similarly to cancer, people getting sick in heart diseases, generally as a result of an unhealthy </span><span class="c2">lifestyle</span><span class="c1">, usually with an emphasis on diet, age, and obesity.<br><br>It&#39;s important to realize though, ever since we went from being hunters-gatherers, to live in villages, our diet became somewhat unideal for how we evolved in the world. People eat these days, way too much sugar, meat, processed carbs, and processed food in general. The reason for that differs from one type of food to another, but generally speaking, it is safe to say that our diet nowadays, is mostly influenced by social norms, habits, and economy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Meat, for</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;example, was considered as a luxury meal not too long ago. Research shows that with the growth in economy, people are eating more and more meat, and thus turning what was once a problem: Not being able to afford meat, to a new more &quot;luxurious&quot; problem: Apparently eating too much of it is unhealthy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">At the end of the day, the more time passes by, the more our society will find solutions to different problems, the more our life gets better in return, which means more new and better problems will arise.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Life is Good</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There&#39;s no doubt that the world is getting a lot safer and convenient with time, and that our quality of life is increasing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If in the past about 90% of people were farmers, our life expectancy was short, we had no choice between different foods we could eat, and couldn&#39;t choose our occupation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In contrast, today only about 3%-4% of the population is more </span><span class="c2">than</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;enough to feed the rest of us, and we will still have enough to export to other countries!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Like seriously, These days we have unmatched freedom that no one in the past could have ever dream of. Imagine we somehow manage to bring a girl from only 500 years ago to modern times, What would be her reaction?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">These days w</span><span class="c1">om</span><span class="c2">e</span><span class="c1">n have full rights and are mostly treated as equal human beings, we can buy whatever food we want for relatively cheap and cook us a meal that a king would have ate not too long ago, we can work at whatever job we choose to, fly abroad and discover many new amazing views, meet fun friends from different far away places, and we have an insane amount of technology to keep us entertained and make our life easier.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can use the Internet to learn whatever I want (and thus give you weird numbers and statistics about the world), I can show people how cute my cat is with video without even getting off my sofa, blow off steam with some realistic video games, or just use my phone when I&#39;m hungry to get a </span><span class="c2">stranger </span><span class="c1">to deliver freshly cooked food straight to my house! (come on, I can&#39;t be the only one who finds that amazing!?)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I like to imagine the world as a positive line on a chart.</span></p>

<p>In the big picture, the more time goes by, the higher the line goes up. There&#39;s no denying that there are downward spikes here and there, that slow the progression, and keep the business men who like looking at charts on their toes.</span></p><p class="c3" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c1">Unfortunately it&#39;s the same with our history, and we had some downward spikes in the past, and probably will have more in the future, however as time goes by it does seem that these spikes are becoming less frequent, and if you remember to look at the whole picture, it&#39;s almost impossible to stay pessimistic. So far it&#39;s evident that things overall are getting better and better. The world becomes more safe, life becomes easier, we live longer, become healthier, and find many different ways to entertain ourselves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Our lives</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">are</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;awesome!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Why Are We Complaining Then?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Human nature is proven to always seek to improve upon our current situation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A famous study in psychology actually covered this subject, and called it the &quot;The Hedonic Treadmill&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The study originally appeared after examining the feelings of different lottery winners, and recording their feelings over time to see if they stay happy for the upcoming years.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The study found that eventually the winners would get </span><span class="c2">used</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to their new lifestyle, and the amount of happiness, sadness, anxiety and anger they would feel, would be quite similar to those of a control group, who didn&#39;t win anythin</span><span class="c2">g</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">To counter this, they also studied accident victims who lost limbs and body parts, and studied their feelings as well</span><span class="c2">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">They </span><span class="c1">discovered that </span><span class="c2">the second group </span><span class="c1">too, would eventually stop feeling sad and return to the same feeling pattern they had before the accident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The theory of the hedonic treadmill, basically makes the argument that humans have a tendency to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness, despite major positive or negative events or life changes. According to this theory, &ldquo;as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This actually makes a lot of sense</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;if you look at this from a survival standpoint.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Imagine two groups of people, one group would be generally happy and satisfied in any situation that life throws at them, while the other would be a tiny bit unsatisfied all the time, and would always feel like there&rsquo;s more that needs to be done. Who would advance faster? or actually a better question would be, who would advance at all?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If people would be completely satisfied in any situation, then there would be no need to improve upon it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">If we&rsquo;re generally happy, but a tiny bit unsatisfied all the time, that gives us the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;drive to advance, not accept the current situation, and figure out solutions to our problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ultimately t</span><span class="c1">his</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">mechanism </span><span class="c2">is what </span><span class="c1">keeps us advancing so fast, and what makes sure we would</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;improve</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;our quality of life </span><span class="c1">as time passes. However it&rsquo;s also what keeps us seeing the negatives, and what causes us to endlessly keep finding things to complain about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Einstein once brilliantly put it:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c7">&quot;Just as a stream flows smoothly as long as it encounters no obstruction, so the nature of man and animal is such that we never really notice or become conscious of what is agreeable to our will; if we are to notice something, our will has to have been thwarted, has to have experienced a shock of some kind. On the other hand, all that opposes, frustrates and resists our will, that is to say all that is unpleasant and painful, impresses itself upon us instantly, directly and with great clarity. Just as we are conscious not of the healthiness of our whole body but only the little place where the shoe pinches, so we think not of the totality of our successful activities but of some insignificant trifle or other which continues to vex us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All of us are affected by this to some degree, however it is definitely something that we might mistakenly find ourselves diving in deeper.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"><br>All of us know those people who seem to only see the negatives in life. Complaining over and over, and never really stopping to see the big picture and enjoy what they already have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ultimately, this happens when we convince ourselves that happiness is achievable if we manage to reach our goals or fix our problems: &ldquo;If only I could get that job I want&rdquo;, &ldquo;If only I could make my crush fall in love with me&rdquo;, &ldquo;If only I would manage to have that beach body I want&rdquo;, if I do that, then</span><span class="c2 c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I will finally be happy, and everything will be great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is impossible of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This belief sucks people into an endless trap where they work hard, strive for better, improving on their situation while always seeing the negatives and feeling that it&rsquo;s not yet good enough. This happens because they&rsquo;re looking for their happiness in the future, and the future never comes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m not saying for a second that we should completely stop complaining. In fact it&rsquo;s quite the opposite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I believe that to make sure that we aren&rsquo;t trapping ourselves in this mindset, we should not put our happiness as a future goal, but rather we should focus on seeing the present, and letting our feelings be felt. Sometimes to complain and let ourselves feel the frustration, and sometimes to hang out with our friends and feel the enjoyment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we realize that reaching our goals would not lead us to permanent happiness, then we free ourselves up from the chase, and we can let ourselves notice all of the awesome shit that already exists around us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is important, not only because this lets us remove weight and stress from our shoulders, but because by doing so, it gives us motivation to strive from a place of curiosity. To work and advance, not because we hope it will make our pain go away, but because we believe in what we&rsquo;re doing. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">And if you ask me, that&rsquo;s a lot better than believing that the world is fucked.</span></p>
