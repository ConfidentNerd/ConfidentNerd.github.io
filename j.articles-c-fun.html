<p class="c5"><span class="c1">Traveling alone around Europe was an interesting experience, I&#39;ve met many people in really random ways, and if I had a good feeling about someone, I felt completely comfortable to just join them on their night out or plans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Today I want to talk about something I&#39;ve learned when I joined a group of girls when I was clubbing in Moldova. This is not a story about my adventures, or a lesson about how to pick up girls, but rather, we&#39;re going to focus about how to experience pure fun, and how many people are messing that up!</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Sounds interesting? than let&#39;s not waste time, and dive right in!</span></p><h2 class="c4"><span class="c14 c9">Alone in Chisinau</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Being a solo traveler, you learn to appreciate your desires, and do the things that are interesting for you. some places are overwhelming and filled with locations and activities that you want to check out, Chisinau is definitely not one of them. However, despite the fact it has a small amount of things to do compared to the popular destinations like Budapest, every place here seems to have it&#39;s own kind of charm, and that makes you want to stay until you actually been to all of the places.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">One of the downfalls for me, was that I hated everything that there is to do about clubs. I hated that you need to dance for hours, you can&#39;t communicate with anyone, you can&#39;t be funny or witty, and it felt very superficial, especially if you&#39;re trying to socialize or meet someone. That&#39;s why I usually go for a drink in a bar.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">-Unfortunately (or actually fortunately?), there wasn&#39;t many other things to do around, and I checked all the bars and pubs already. so there I was, standing in front of the popular club of Chisinau.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">On my way inside, right by the entrance, I notice there&#39;s a little bar (yay!) and instantly I see 3 beautiful girls, probably some of the most beautiful ones in the club, sitting there and laughing around.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">I ordered a drink and decided to join them.</span></p><h2 class="c4"><span class="c9 c14">Just Enjoy the Experience</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c1">My plan for the night was to just have fun, and I wasn&#39;t aiming to achieve any more than that. When talking to the girls it seems that none of them were looking for any man, even without them saying it, it didn&#39;t felt like there was much flirting going on, but rather a really nice and friendly connection was building up.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">I was glad I found some fun people to hang around with, and we decided to go inside the club, where things got a little interesting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">As I said, I hated to dance in clubs, it usually felt very fake and superficial, however this time dancing with the girls, I wasn&#39;t paying any attention to my moves or how I dance, but rather, I was hypnotized by how much fun the girls are having.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">This was really mind blowing because I slowly realized that the fun in clubs isn&#39;t about how you express yourself, but rather to soak up the sound and environment, and just do what feels right to you.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">If you feel like dancing energetically, than do it, if you feel like standing and moving slowly with your hands in your pockets than do that. you&#39;re not expected to be the life of the party, so don&#39;t worry about how you move, and just enjoy the smiles that the people around you have.</span></p><h2 class="c4"><span class="c3">Don&#39;t Fake </span><span class="c9">t</span><span class="c3">he Fun</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c1">As you can imagine, dancing with hot girls in a club, many guys started to dance around us, and this was quite an interesting thing to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Some guys would try to creepily dance near the girls while some would try to convince the girls to dance with them, however there was one thing that was clear as glass, the girls I was with, were having way more fun than the guys!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Think about it like this, If you&#39;re enjoying yourself when dancing and having pure fun with your friends, why would you try to search for something more?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">The guys that were hitting on the girls and trying to dance near them, seemed like they were smiling, giving each-other high fives, and dancing energetically, however, it was clear as day it was an act. They weren&#39;t having true genuine fun (at least not near the girls), but rather having fun to achieve something. Basically fun wasn&#39;t the end goal but rather a means to a different end!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Very soon I noticed how the girls reacted to it. They just moved away and kept focusing on the music and their friends. They weren&#39;t trying to have fun, but rather having fun was a side effect of noticing the experience, and doing whatever feels right to them.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">They never tried to give an impression or prove anything. When they weren&#39;t having fun they would feel free to stand around the dance floor, go sit down, or go outside and take a break, and when they felt silly, they would feel free to dance battle the creeps because that shit was funny as hell.</span></p><h2 class="c4"><span class="c14 c9">The Vicious Cycle</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c1">In the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t matter where you are, or what the situation is, if you just listen to your feelings, and focus on the experience you&#39;re having, than fun might arise in it&#39;s purest form.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Many people going to clubs and watching how everyone else are having fun, feel pressured to have fun as-well and be a part of the group, however, this leads to a known paradox.</span></p><ul class="c10 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c11"><span class="c1">If you try to have fun, you&#39;re getting further away from having fun</span></li></ul><ul class="c10 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c11"><span class="c1">If you&#39;re trying to hold on to the fun you&#39;re having, it will escape faster</span></li></ul><p class="c5"><span class="c1">This is actually a known thing in psychology, and it&#39;s called a vicious cycle. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">-When you&#39;re feeling anxious for example, if you don&#39;t want to be anxious and try to push that feeling to cool down, you&#39;re basically getting yourself to be anxious about getting anxious, which in return makes you feel even more and more anxious. This can happen with all kinds of feelings, you could also be angry about being angry, or get sad about being sad.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Fun is an elusive feeling, because you feel it strongest when you let go of your desire to have a certain experience, and just let yourself be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Obviously, I&#39;m making this sound a bit more extreme than it is in a club. However, this is very significant in our everyday life.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">This vicious cycle isn&#39;t that clearly noticeable, and unfortunately even if you&#39;re educated about it, you might experience this cycle again and again because it&#39;s very subtle.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Luckily, there&#39;s a trick to know if you&rsquo;re getting stuck in this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">If you&#39;re catching yourself wishing you&#39;d feel different than you&#39;re currently feeling in the present (like wanting to not be nervous when talking to a girl, wanting to have fun like everyone else, or wishing you could relax when you&#39;re pissed off) than by definition you are treating your feelings as a means to an end, and you&#39;re trapping yourself in this cycle. (Yes, just wanting to feel in a different way is enough to trigger this &#x1f605;)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Instead, </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">If you want to experience true fun, than stop trying to have it.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">If you go to a club and don&#39;t feel like dancing, than don&#39;t. And if you feel pressure because of that, don&#39;t try to push it away.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c14 c16">You should strive to experience your feelings fully</span><span class="c1">, instead of striving to have one feeling over the other.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Eventually, when you accept your emotions, and get comfortable to act on them, than you&#39;re free to notice the present and your surroundings, and that may bring up many new and pleasant feelings on it&#39;s own.</span></p>
