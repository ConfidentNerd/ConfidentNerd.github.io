<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I remember not too long ago, me and my friend were having a discussion. Like many other people, we both tend to get sucked in to a binge marathon of Brooklyn nine-nine, when taking a break from working on our projects and studies.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I wish there was a way to take a productive break&quot; Is what he told me, and I instantly agreed, but than was full of questions that were popping up...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Isn&#39;t a break by definition unproductive? a break is supposed to make you relax and re-energized, how can something productive ever be relaxing? won&#39;t that just feel like a chore?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Luckily, I managed to answer those questions, and I was surprised by the result.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this article we&#39;re going to explore the depths of Productive Relaxation, and as scary and unexciting as it sounds, Productive Relaxation is actually one of the better most fulfilling ideas I had lately.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Are you ready? Let&#39;s dive in.</span><a id="id.30j0zll"></a></p><h2 class="c8"><span class="c1">The Mechanics</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Productive Relaxation works on 3 simple principles that form together a fulfilling way to relax while working towards your goals.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Those principles are: </span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Finding your goals and passions </span></li><li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Making them easy to apply in your day to day life and busy schedule </span></li><li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Experimenting - Making sure you&#39;re more relaxed and energized after practicing them</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c0">TL; DR - You try to find passive ways to improve in things that are important to you while resting by changing existing habits. Want to learn about it in a deeper level? Keep reading..</span><a id="id.1fob9te"></a></p><h3 class="c4"><span class="c7">Finding your goals and passions</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Every person has something that fills them up with energy, and every person (hopefully) has hobbies, and goals.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of the core principles for Productive Relaxation is to realize what those things are for you, and get in to the habit of doing them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some people are passionate about writing, some about reading, some about playing and learning music, and others about socializing and having conversations over a beer and some tacos.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Usually things you are passionate about, are things that you are already doing, or at least thinking about starting to do on a daily basis.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You should think of things that you like doing </span><span class="c10">AND</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;want to improve at, or be better as a result of doing them (like reading)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you gather some ideas of things you could apply, it would help you with the next principle</span><a id="id.3znysh7"></a></p><h3 class="c4"><span class="c7">Replace old habits</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This one is very personal, everyone have different habits they&#39;re doing, however, if we understand how they work we could have tremendous power.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We operate on old habits. If I want to start practicing something new, it would be a massive challenge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If I want to start to workout for example, I would need to find a time in the day where I could practice it, which means I&#39;ll have to sacrifice that time from doing other things. Also, It would take a while for me to push myself until working out would actually become a habit of mine aswell. therefore it would be a hard task to achieve (Thankfully not impossible).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An easier thing that we can do, is incorporate a new habit inside an old one. </span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">If we have a habit of eating while watching YouTube videos and we want to read more, we could just load some interesting E-books instead </span></li><li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">If we have a habit of eating a bar of chocolate before bed, and we want to eat healthier, we could just replace the sweets in our house with a banana (or any other fruit, but bananas are awesome) </span></li><li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">If we want to Improve our writing, and have the habit of just randomly turning on the PC with no purpose and being sucked in to Facebook as a result (guilty as charged), than we could just make sure a word document pops up as soon as the computer gets turned on (if you want to do that just google it).</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Doing those things would make creating a better habit way easier, because you&rsquo;ll have less steps to achieve your goals. For example, you won&rsquo;t need to get mentally ready, turn on the PC and open a word document, but all you need to do is just write a sentence or two because the page is already loaded!</span></p><h3 class="c4"><span class="c7">Experimenting</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now is the part that actually makes sure we relax while practicing our new habits.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All people are driven by emotion. This was proven by research, and it&#39;s very important that we understand this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">-If you workout regularly for example, even though you feel pain while doing the exercises, it means that the good feeling you have after you workout, and the way you feel good about yourself because your doing so, out weights the pain of the exercises.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All of us are driven by emotion and good feelings, we </span><span class="c10">DO NOT</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;make choices by logic. If I don&#39;t like my job, and I&#39;ll feel bad and miserable from working there, than my brain will come up with logical excuses of why I should quit my job. Basically logic is a slave of our emotions, and it only gives us the impression that it is in charge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why was this important to understand? Well, when you&#39;re trying out new hobbies, or trying to replace old ones for better ones, than the </span><span class="c11">best </span><span class="c0">way for the new hobby to stick, is if you enjoy practicing it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I used to have a habit of eating while watching YouTube videos or TV series on my computer screen. When I switched to reading E-books instead, I really enjoyed that. I felt like I&#39;m finally reading more, achieving more, and it was a pretty passive and easy activity. However, this isn&#39;t always the case. I had times where I tried new things and they felt like a chore, or like something I have to push myself to do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Things like that might work for a little bit, but motivation fades, and if it is hard to do and you need to push yourself to do it, than by definition it&rsquo;s not something that will leave you more relaxed and energized. If that happens, it only means you haven&#39;t found the right method or the right thing to practice yet.</span><a id="id.2et92p0"></a></p><h3 class="c4"><span class="c7">Don&#39;t give up</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s important you don&#39;t give up, and keep looking for ways to implement your new habits, until you find a way that you like and feel fulfilled and energized by.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Almost always when you&rsquo;re trying to build or break a habit, you will fail. However, this is to be expected, and it shouldn&rsquo;t stop you from working towards things that are important to you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Great things are almost never done by a single act, but by repeated daily action.<br>If you could control your habits, you could create and achieve almost anything you&rsquo;d put your mind to. So don&rsquo;t give up, and keep coming with new ways and ideas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s make a quick recap, - to practice Productive Relaxation you should:</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Find things that are important to you (things you want to improve at, or things you&rsquo;d like to do more often), Replace or combine your old habits with your new goals, and experiment around to see what&rsquo;s fun for you and what gets you to feel relaxed and energized.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">When you do all of those things, you&rsquo;re almost guaranteed to improve some of your old habits, and incorporate new ones without too much hard work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is it for this article, I hope you found it helpful, and that it was a fun read!<br>Now it&rsquo;s time for you to go and do your thing, see you in the next article!</span></p>
